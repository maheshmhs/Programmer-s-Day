#EngineeringImpact

Human beings have always been able to do seemingly impossible things. We have conquered not only land but also air, water and even outer space. Had it not been our engineering apptitude we would probably have been extinct long time back with all kinds of adverse climatic conditions. We built everything that we thought would improve our lives. And we continue to do so. Our creativity always helped us invent and achieve these greate feats. While engineers have been at the center of all these creations, a very creative section of our population was deprived of creating the engineering masterpieces. Artists have always been considered very creative yet have very little contribution to engineering.
One very important impact engineering has given is the ability for everyone to communicate irrespective of disability, language barriers or distance. Matt Damon can talk to people from Mars. Although its in just a movie today this reality is not very far. 

This program itself is one of the engineering impact. It gives equal opportunities in programming to that creative sectors.  Artits can now paint their program and be part of this engineering revolution. Although not very practical yet, this programming language just proves that engineering is limitless.
