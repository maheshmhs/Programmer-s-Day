#EngineeringImpact

We didn't have wings but wanted to fly, so we built airplanes. We didn't have fins we built ships. Similarly we built vehicles, bridges, rockets,hospitals. We did everything we wanted to do and will continue to do. This tiny speck in the universe is probably the most advanced place. All thanks to engineering.

We are much safer against epidemics and adverse climates. We live longer and probably happier today than those who lived here few centuries earlier.Had it not been engineers we would have been extinct a long time back. All those creatures like dinosaurs are probably regretting for not having engineers in their species.

Whatever we see today is an impact of engineering. Infact our own existence till today speaks volume of the impact engineering has.Being able to write this program itself is a beautiful proof of what engineering can do. All those creative painters today can now write a computer program by just using their paint. 

This program is written in a language called PIET.  Image itself it the program.

To run: Any existing piet interpreter or compiler can be used. Or you can create your own interpreter :).  
Easiest is to use online versions. This program was tested at http://www.bertnase.de/npiet/npiet-execute.php . 
Just upload the image and execute it and find out yourself what First Hand Foundation is.
